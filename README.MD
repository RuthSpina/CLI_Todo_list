#CLI To Do List
I've created a To Do List Application that runs on the command line:
My To Do List prompts users to add new items, allows them to add text items, and gives them the ability to remove completed items as well.
My code allows for upper and lowercase inputs from user for all menu items and removes whitespace and special characters from all strings.
